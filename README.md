# Discord Bot Powered by Advanced AI

This Discord bot leverages modern generative AI API services to facilitate engaging, context-aware interactions on Discord. It not only handles natural language conversations but also supports image generation and web search integration—all through asynchronous API requests.

## Features

• Connects seamlessly to Discord using the Discord API.  
• Engages users with intelligent, text-based responses generated by an AI language model.  
• Offers multiple response modes (detailed, succinct, and creative) to suit your needs.  
• Supports referencing previous messages for improved context.  
• Integrates optional web search functionality to supplement responses with up-to-date information.  
• Includes AI-powered image generation capabilities for creating visuals directly from prompts.  

## Installation

  OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-ai-api-key>  
  SYSTEM_PROMPT=<your-system-prompt>  
  BOT_TAG=<your-bot-tag>

Replace the placeholder values with your Discord bot token, your AI API key, your desired system prompt, and the tag used to mention the bot.

## Usage

1. Start the bot by running:

  python bot.py

2. The bot will connect to your Discord server and begin listening for commands.

3. To interact with the bot, simply mention it with your query. For example:

  @YourBotTag What’s a good recipe for spaghetti carbonara?

4. To select a different response mode, add the corresponding suffix to your message:
  • `-v` for a detailed reply  
  • `-c` for a creative spin

Example:

  @YourBotTag Explain quantum mechanics -v

5. For improved context, you can reply to a previous message while mentioning the bot. This allows the bot to reference earlier messages in the conversation as needed.
